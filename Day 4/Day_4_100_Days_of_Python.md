# Day 4: 100 Days of Python

Today, I explored several foundational concepts that are crucial for handling and manipulating lists effectively in Python:

## Key Learnings:
1. **Nested Lists (2D Lists):**
   - Learned how to create and navigate lists that contain other lists as elements.
   - Examples include matrices or tabular data representation.
   - Accessing elements using multiple indices.

2. **`remove()` Function:**
   - Understand how to remove the first occurrence of a specified value in a list.

3. **`sort()` Function:**
   - Sorting a list in ascending order permanently using the `sort()` method.

4. **Reverse Sorting:**
   - Using `sort(reverse=True)` to sort a list permanently in descending order.

5. **`sorted()` Function:**
   - Temporary sorting using the `sorted()` function.
   - Does not modify the original list, providing flexibility in certain scenarios.

## Reflection:
Working with these functions and concepts opens the door to processing more complex data structures and sets a strong foundation for solving various real-world problems. Understanding sorting and list manipulation is essential for optimizing code and organizing data efficiently.

**Progress is cumulative!** I'm excited to apply these learnings in more complex projects soon.
