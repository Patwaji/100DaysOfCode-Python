# 100 Days of Python - Day 3

## Topics Covered:
- **Control Flow**:  
  Learned how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for managing control flow in a program. These statements help in making decisions based on certain conditions.

- **Logical Operators**:  
  Gained an understanding of logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` to handle multiple conditions in decision-making.

- **List Data Structure**:
  - Learned that `list[-1]` corresponds to the last element, and `list[-2]` to the second last element, and so on.
  - Explored various useful functions and methods:
    - `.append(value)` to add an element at the end of the list.
    - `.insert(index, value)` to insert an element at a specific position in the list.
    - `del list[index]` to remove an element at the specified index.
    - `.pop(index)` to remove and return the element at the specified index.
  - Discussed various use cases for these methods.

### Key Takeaways:
1. Control flow with `if`, `elif`, `else` is essential for dynamic decision-making in programs.
2. Lists are highly versatile and their negative indexing is convenient for accessing elements from the end of the list.
3. Built-in functions like `.append()`, `.insert()`, and `.pop()` make working with lists efficient.
