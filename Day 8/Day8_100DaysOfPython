# Day 8 of 100 Days of Python

## Topics Covered

### 1. If Statements in a List
- Learned how to use if statements with lists.
- Explored how to check elements against a condition.
- Example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]
```

### 2. Boolean Expressions and Efficiency
- Studied Boolean expressions and their evaluations (`True` or `False`).
- Boolean expressions help create concise and readable code.
- Example:

```python
# Traditional approach
is_adult = False
if age >= 18:
    is_adult = True

# Efficient Boolean expression
is_adult = age >= 18
```

- Using efficient Boolean expressions reduces unnecessary lines and enhances performance.

### 3. Styling If Statements
- Followed best practices to improve code readability.
- Used indentation and spacing standards.
- Ensured no unnecessary else statements in some conditions.
- Examples:

#### Clear If Statement
```python
if condition:
    do_something()
```

#### Avoiding Unnecessary Else
```python
if condition:
    do_something()
return  # Instead of placing code in else block
```

#### Consistent Indentation
- Always use 4 spaces for Python indentation.

## Summary
- Applied `if` statements effectively in lists.
- Learned the value of Boolean expressions for writing efficient code.
- Practiced styling techniques to enhance code clarity.
